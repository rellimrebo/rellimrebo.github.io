The sky was still black. The parking lot was empty, save for one large grey van parked in the corner. The van was the home of an impoverished man by the name Derrick-or-something-like-that who lived with two undersized German shepherds. I always thought it was a bit odd that he would pick the one broken lamppost to park under. You would think that the constant flickering would keep you up but maybe he knows something I don’t.</p><p>I parked in the opposite corner from the van, like Mom told me to. It always felt a bit inhuman but apparently this-is-not-a-hill-to-die-on-and-Jesus-died-for-my-sins so I just did like she said. My father would grimace with his eyes but say statistics-are-statistics and that would be that.</p><p>Well fuck. The dumpster is overflowing again. We (as in the evergrateful-team-family that is the pool staff) were currently in a feud with our local garbage truck drivers. Apparently John or someone had propped up a piece of serrated glass of “substantial size” on the side of the dumpster. When the driver went to load it in, he gave himself a cut that resulted in an ER visit and a weekend health and safety seminar. It seemed kinda stupid to me. Why didn’t the driver just load the dumpster and leave the glass? I heard whoever it was got a nice settlement though, so that’s how it goes.</p><p>Whatever reason aside, now someone would have to load up their car with whichever garbage bags hadn’t split open and drive them over to the gym three blocks away which had more than enough room. The gym owner didn’t like it very much but someone’s ex worked over there so the gate to the dumpsters was usually unlocked.</p><p>I walked over the pool gate and tested it. The interior bar rattled against its enclosure on the other side. John didn’t trust any of us with the keys, which I guess makes sense, but then again maybe he should show up first.</p><p>Crawling through the side window the busted lock always felt a little strange. When doing something that looks as crime-y as breaking into your own workplace, you feel an urge to look over your shoulder to make sure that no one is watching to think it’s a crime. But I think that makes it look more like a crime, like you know it’s wrong. Coming through to the other side, I turned on my phone flashlight to see what I was stepping on. There was a small table to step onto but oftentimes someone would leave their towel or sunglasses.</p><p>I’m in. The soft blink of the microwave clock’s 12:00 oriented me while also reminding me that it was my turn to clean it. There would be time for that later.</p><p>Squinting my eyes in anticipation, I flicked my palm upwards at the lightly colored square on the wall to turn on the office lights. The sharp buzz of the overhead lights abruptly cut through the silence of the room, filling my ears then dissipating like water.</p><p>I gave my finger to the clock-in machine and that was that. I was again part of the machine. Walking out of the staffroom to the deck always spooked me a bit. Thousands of gallons of water pressed flat at the surface sheening at me. I walked quickly into the equipment closet.</p><p>The door creaked open on hinges last surveyed by some guy back in the 60s, revealing a small concrete interior. The walls stood barricaded behind rows of metal shelving, each flush with disinfectant and paper towels. The floor was lined with boxes of whole-purchased trash bags, all sorted to be picked up then thrown down again.</p><p>You’d think the room with all the cleaning supplies would be cleanest, and I guess it looked that way. The floor in the center of the room had a nice shine to it and the thick huff of chemicals left a bit of a sunshine haze. But behind the shelves dirt filled out every crack and crease of the room as if it was foam coming to rest on the shore. Half-buried insect corpses looked on with blank eyes at a sun unseen behind the metal door.</p><p>Clamping some disinfectant between my elbows, I grabbed a bottle of bleach and a roll of paper towels. I backed out of the room.</p><p>The thing about working the early morning shift is that you’re left with the most maintenance work of the entire day. Whatever filth had collected or objects that had been broken the previous afternoon and evening were left for me. I think John knew that it fell on me, but he didn’t seem to mind much. These days I’m not sure what John wants at all. He bitches about his stupid-fucking-girlfriend a lot, but the longing looks he gives at the community college water polo team says something different. Poor John.</p><p>To be frank, it wasn’t that bad. There’s a certain odd satisfaction to cleaning every inch of a bathroom. Every sweep of the floor and spray of bleach felt as if I was spreading myself. A small ownership. Possession.</p><p>Forgotten goggles, faded striped towels, reading glasses. Imagining the person behind the objects gave a greater adventure than film or books ever did. The objects rarely disappoint. They don’t leave you clamoring for a second act or commentary. They are, and the story is.</p><p>Chrrt. I’ve stepped on something. A small grey-no-green piece of paper. Fifty dollars. Some sort of blue stuff smeared over Grant’s left eye.</p><p>Suddenly that hungry feeling that consumes teenage millionaires and lottery winners was me. This could mean mint chip ice cream for the next couple months and not that discount store-brand shit that tastes like freezer-burned pizza. Or some new spoons. I did need some spoons. I suspect my last roommate stole mine on the way out. The possibilities.</p><p>A find of this value has to be protected. John wouldn’t approve. He would take it.</p><p>My car. Glovebox. Under the gum.</p><p>I strode quickly back to the staffroom and jumped back through the window, stumbling down onto the concrete. Smooth.</p><p>A silver sedan was straddled next to my blue one. Not worrying. John often slept before work. Working as a night janitor was tiring.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>I was in the car. The glove box opened with a soft reluctant click, where a half-pack of minty gum lay. Stashing the bill, my body slumped. I checked on John.</p><p>Asleep, caressing the steering wheel. It was a little impressive that he managed to sleep there without beeping the horn. Maybe I would be okay.</p><p>The blinking light in my side mirror said otherwise. A lone figure was outside by Derrick’s van. He was cradling his head. Was he looking over? He could feel my greed through the millimeters of steel encasing me. He was me. He was John. I was him. I am him.</p><p>I turned on the radio.</p><p>-ome back to 87.3 The Vine playing your latest tra-</p><p>I could see the sun now. If I left my car here it would heat up and be unpleasant to sit in after work. I would move it, just for convenience’s sake.</p><p>Backing out, I saw the figure’s head raise up in a question mark as I circled the parking lot. I made my way around to the side shaded by the trees. The bill buried in my glovebox began rattling violently. With each push of the gas closer to the van it made another attempt to lunge out, beating at the sides of a 90s faux-leather interior. I stopped.
Derrick gave a little wave through my shotgun window, five feet away. Mom’s screaming again and the radio can’t quite blanket the sound. I turned off the car and cracked the door.</p><p>Already halfway out of the car I whispered</p><p>Mornin—</p><p>Derrick is holding a finger against a slight grin, his other hand gesturing to the van.</p><p>His dogs.</p><p>I gave a small wave and headed back to jump through the window. Walking, I glanced back and saw him still in the same position, head slightly tilted. Curious?</p><p>It was beyond me. Opening was in fifteen, and John prefers to have both bathrooms cleaned out and chems checked before he arrives. More time to nap. He needs his rest.</p><p>There would be time to buy spoons later.</p></span></section><hr><footer><nav><ul><li>© 2020</li></ul></nav></footer></main></body></html>
