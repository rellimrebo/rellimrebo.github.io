Hi there.

I'm Andrew, and sometimes I like to write. 

This past year and half I've made a concerted effort to finish short stories I start. I'm hoping that posting on this ~~very clean and aesthetically pleasing~~ website will encourage me to keep writing as I watch the quality and quantity of my work grow over time. 

Feel free to send me feedback through Instagram or email me at obermiller44 (at) gmail (dot) com.



Also, quick shoutout to my friend Shane for teaching me how to set this up and struggling through Hugo with me.
