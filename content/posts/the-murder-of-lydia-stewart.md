*Note from the author: I started this around 6 months ago then immediately dropped it (so much for finishing writing projects). I saw it in my notes a few days ago and realized I wanted to write an end to it, even if it isn't the best. Enjoy!*


The kids at school think that Lydia Stewart moved away, but I know better. Lydia died fourteen days ago on Friday, May the Twelfth. This would be an odd thing for me to know, save for two essential truths:

1. I watched the hearse carry her body away
2. I killed Lydia Stewart

So now I spend my daily hour in Ms. Davis’s class staring at the back of the foreign exchange student who moved up to take her seat in the first row. Wondering what she would be thinking about right now. Trying to figure out if she was the sort of person who actually did the reading or just copied the online summary like the rest of us. Sitting here waiting for her to die the second time, when the only memories of her that remain are yearbook signatures and club photos.

Before we continue you should know that I did not know Lydia Stewart. Well, not know-know, if that makes sense. That category of people that belongs to the once-conversations at the coffee shop and pleasantries at the airport. Another one for the crowd in the back of my mind. We probably would never have spoken at all had we not been lumped together for a biology project a year before.

Maybe that would’ve been better. 

Lydia was intelligent. And not the “wow you’re smart” sort of smart. People smart. Eyes that bore beneath your skin and see who you are. Yes, these were things I just assumed (because she didn’t talk much anyways) but you can always sort of tell with that sort.

She went to class, turned in work on time, and that is the end of the story I know. I spent the first week looking back trying to find pictures of the two of us together. Trying to form a narrative that neatly begins and ends with us. Hours of scouring old scrapbooks and yearbooks turned up only a sole fifth grade class photo. No Shakespeare, no poetic ending or twist, just regular fucked-up life. 

Did she know then that I would be the one who ended it all? That I would choose the spot on the page that the words stopped? Looking up out of the photo, would she recognize the murder weapon tucked in my pocket?

A silver smartphone. Over the eleven years I had “known” Lydia Stewart we had one point of hard contact, during that biology project. A single text sent on late on a Tuesday.  

*It’s done. Please add the bibliography when ready.*

Words of the dead hold a certain intrigue to them. We search through long forgotten letters and tombstone engravings, looking for a shadow of the person that chose them. But whatever hidden meaning there was to the life of Lydia Stewart lay permanently obscured by the glare of time and substance, and so she would remain a mystery. 

There was the other time, of course. An attempted call from her number at 2:03 a.m., eleven minutes before I killed her. But there was nothing to further learn from that declined call. Probably an accident. 

Why did she call? 

God knows I haven’t called anyone in quite some time. The obligatory annual thank you’s and how are you’s to family.  People just don’t do that anymore. Typing is easier; there’s less effort involved. Moving your thumbs a few centimeters, you don’t even have to worry about typos or what to say. It’s all recommended for us. No way for someone on the other end to hear the anxiety creep into your voice or your attention start to wander.

*So why did she call?*

It must’ve been a mistake. She was looking for some homework help or trying to confide in a friend. She misdialed, I hung up.

There was another possibility though. The possibility that she really did want to speak with me, her neighbor across the street. Or maybe it was more bio homework.

It was true, Lydia wasn’t known to be very popular. I can’t remember seeing her with a constant group of friends or any friend, for that matter. But being alone isn’t what killed Lydia Stewart, it was the timing. 

At 2 AM she must have seen my window lit up, the only one on a sleep street in the suburbs. Working at a paper due 3 hours earlier and short 300 words. I assume she saw me, because I saw her. 
She had a bit of a surreal look about her, wearing a purple hoodie with yellow polka dot pajama pants. My window light falling on across the poplar tree in her front yard, one of the branches throwing a line of black across her body.

And then she called.

“Lukas?”

Ms. Davis was looking at me. 

“Are you still with us?”

I nodded.

“Alright then. Everyone turn to page 273-”

But at that moment I did not care in the slightest what lay on page 273. I concerned myself with what Lydia was thinking that Thursday night as she gazed up at my window from across the street. If the light hitting her eyes reflected heaven. If she forgot for a moment the ground and wind, just to look.

I was watching that night. Watching as she set the stool down under that old poplar tree she had put a birdhouse up in so long ago. Watching as she tiptoed to reach the grip of the lowest branch.

Yes, the class may not know it, but I killed Lydia Stewart, watching her noose drop from across the street.
