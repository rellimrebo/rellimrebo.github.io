The kids at school think that Lydia Stewart moved away, but I know better. Lydia died fourteen days ago on Friday, May the Twelfth. This would be an odd thing for me to know, save for two essential truths:

1. I watched the hearse carry her body away
2. I killed Lydia Stewart

So now I spend my daily hour in AP Literature staring at the back of the foreign exchange student who moved up to take her seat in the first row. Wondering what she would be thinking about right now. Trying to figure out if she was the sort of person who actually did the reading or just copied the online summary like the rest of us. Sitting here waiting for her to die the second time, when the only memories of her that remain are yearbook signatures and club photos.

Before we continue you should know that I did not know Lydia Stewart. Well, not know-know, if that makes sense. That category of people that belongs to the once-conversations at the coffee shop and pleasantries at the airport. Another one for the crowd in the back of my mind. We probably would never have spoken at all had we not been lumped together for a biology project a year before.

Maybe that would’ve been better. 

Lydia was intelligent. And not the “wow you’re smart” sort of smart. People smart. Eyes that bore beneath your skin and see who you are. Yes, these were things I just assumed (because she didn’t talk much anyways) but you can always sort of tell with that sort.

She went to class, turned in work on time, and that is the end of the story I know. I spent the first week looking back trying to find pictures of the two of us together. Trying to form a narrative that neatly begins and ends with us. Hours of scouring old scrapbooks and yearbooks turned up only a sole fifth grade class photo. No Shakespeare, no poetic ending or twist, just regular fucked-up life. 

Did she know then that I would be the one who ended it all? That I would choose the spot on the page that the words stopped? Looking up out of the photo, would she recognize the murder weapon tucked in my pocket?
